# Combining trait, weather, and image datasets

The objective of this vignette is to join and plot the trait and weather data, and also the trait and image data. 

The first synthesis plot will be of the greenness from the image data against the canopy cover from the trait data. 
The second synthesis plot will be a histogram of the inflection points for each cultivar's growing degree days. 

## Plot growing degree days for each cultivar


## Do logistic regression


## Create histogram of regression output for all cultivars


## Calculate greenness metric for each image


## Combine with canopy cover and plot
